We carefully document the artifact about the tools used in our paper and the code about 
ClozeMaster
. More details can be found here.
We provide a Docker Image in the artifact. After entering the container, it's covenient to verify and validate our work by using the provided scripts. We provide the source code in the artifact for manul installation as well.
We place the artifact on a publicly accessible archival repository (this repo).
